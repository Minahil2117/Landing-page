# Landing-page
From concept to conversion: Building a luxury fragrance experience. 🕊️✨

I recently challenged myself to design and develop a high-end landing page for HER Essence, a fictional luxury perfume brand. The goal was to marry minimalist aesthetic with high-performance code.

# Key features include:

Immersive Hero Section: Utilizing a split-layout to balance bold typography with product imagery.

Interactive Scent Journey: Smooth-scroll animations (AOS) to guide the user through olfactory notes.

Conversion-First Design: A strategic "Limited Offer" section designed for luxury retail CTA.

Built with: HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Flexbox & Transitions), and JavaScript.
